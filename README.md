### Python-Challenge: 

## PyBank: Financial Analysis
# Project Overview
The PyBank project involves creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a fictitious company. 
Using a dataset of financial records (budget_data.csv), the script calculates several financial metrics.
There are 2 subfolders: Resources and Analysis in the PyBank directory.
The objective is to run a python script that prints the poll results in your local terminal and produce a txt file with the results in the Analysis folder.

# Analysis Goals
The script performs the following calculations:

Total number of months included in the dataset.
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

# Steps
Clone the Repository in your local terminal
Use git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory: Open the terminal and go to the PyBank directory.
Use cd PyBank
Launch main.py file in VS Code to build the python script.
Run the Script: Execute the completed script with Python.
Use python main.py
View the Results: The results should print to the terminal and be saved in the analysis/financial_analysis.txt file.

The results should look like this:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
The script will print the results to the terminal and save them in a text file.

# Print results

Results in txt file should be printed to the Analyis folder.
Use git add ., git commit, and git push to push changes to github respository.

## PyPoll: Election Analysis

# Project Overview
The PyPoll project is designed to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. 
Using Python, the script analyzes a dataset of election results to find several metrics. 
The dataset is provided in a CSV file format found in the "Resources" directory.
There are 2 subfolders: Resources and Analysis in the PyPoll directory.
The objective is to run a python script that prints the poll results in your local terminal and produce a txt file with the results in the Analysis folder.

# Analysis Goals
The script calculates the following values:
1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Steps
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory: Open the terminal and go your PyPoll directory.
cd PyPoll
Launch main.py file in VS Code to build the python script.
Run the Script: Execute the completed script with Python.
Use python main.py
View the Results: The results should print to the terminal and be saved in the analysis/election_results.txt file.
You will need to use git add . and git commit, and git push commands to upload these changes to your github repository.

The printed text in your terminal should look like this:

Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369711
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
-------------------------
The script will print the results to your terminal and save them in a text file in the "Analysis" folder if done correctly.
